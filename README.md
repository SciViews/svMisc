SciViews - miscellaneous functions.

_Build badges are as follows._
- _Status for latest stable R version for both Linux and Mac OS X at left._
- _Status for the devel version of R under Windows at right._ 


## Installation

### Latest stable version

The latest stable version of **svMisc** can simply be installed from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org):

```r
install.packages("svMisc")
```


### Development version

Make sure you have the **devtools** R package installed:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Use `install_github()` to install the **svMisc** package from Github (source from **master** branch will be recompiled on your machine):

```r
devtools::install_github("SciViews/svMisc")
```

R should install all required dependencies automatically, and then it should compile and install **svMisc**.

Latest devel version of **svMisc** (source + Windows binaires for the devel version of R) is also available from [appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/phgrosjean/svMisc/build/artifacts).


## Usage

Make the **svMisc** package available in your R session:

```r
library("svMisc")
```

Get help about this package:

```r
library(help = "svMisc")
help("svMisc-package")
```

## Note to developers

This package used to be developed on R-Forge in the past. However, the latest [R-Forge version](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/sciviews/) was moved to this Github repository on 2016-03-16 (SVN version 569). **Please, do not use R-Forge anymore for SciViews development, use this Github repository instead.**
