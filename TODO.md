# svMisc To Do list

-   How to get vignettes listed in the main help page?

-   The various cases for section and aka printing, and str-ing + example.

-   Same as `pCloud()`, but for OneDrive, Google Drive & Dropbox.

-   For `Install()`, allow to specify the list of packages in `...`, but how to specify installation arguments then? Also, allows to specify from where to install the packages (github, etc. should be also accepted).

-   A function derived from `import::from()`, but that populates `.packages_to_install`; idem for `::`, `:::`, `library()` and `require()`.

-   A list of (remote) sources for packages to install from github, bitbucket, etc. + a list of dependencies and code to run to install these.

-   Specification of dates in RJSON format

-   Make indeterminate `progress()`ion.

-   Use `RShowDoc()` to access further R documentation.

-   Also include `RSiteSearch()`/`helpSearchWeb()`, sos, Rseek, RDocumentation, perhaps in a different function dedicated to search on the web!

-   Update po file.

-   Write a complete battery of tests for this package.
