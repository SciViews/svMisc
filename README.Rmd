{svMisc} provides a series of functions that are used by the other packages that make the SciViews::R dialect. You can also use most of them directly, like a progress bar, a function to run analyses in batch (and recover in case of error), management of a temporary environment, etc.

## Installation

{svMisc} is available from CRAN, but it is an old version. You should install it from the [SciViews R-Universe](https://sciviews.r-universe.dev). To install this package and its dependencies, run the following command in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('svMisc', repos = c('https://sciviews.r-universe.dev',
  'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

An older version of {svMisc} can be installed from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org):

``` r
install.packages("svMisc")
```

You can also install the latest development version. Make sure you have the {remotes} R package installed:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

Use `install_github()` to install the {svMisc} package from GitHub (source from **main** branch will be recompiled on your machine):

``` r
remotes::install_github("SciViews/svMisc")
```

R should install all required dependencies automatically, and then it should compile and install {svMisc}.
